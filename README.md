## FAQs

### Why does my operating system say it's an unrecgonized app?
Telling the operating system that we're a trusted source is expensive.
This is a small open source project and we don't have the funds to correctly
sign the app.

### Why does my antivirus flag this program?
It's a false positive. If you don't trust us, you can look at the code and
compile it yourself. That's one of the beauties of an open source project!

### It's not working. What should I do?
File an issue here with as much detail as you can provide. We're working on
adding additional logging and a bug template to better assist with any issues.
